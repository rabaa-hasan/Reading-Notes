# Node JS
Node.js ia a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer executes.

## Node.js and Support for JavaScript
Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. You are only targeting one runtime and this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and up to date syntax. This also means you should not have to worry about compatibility issues.

## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager
Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed, type npm -v in your terminal. NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the worlds largest software registry. There are well over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScrip code available to download, with billions of downloads each week.

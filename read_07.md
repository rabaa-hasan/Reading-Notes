## REST
Roy Fielding helped to build the modern internet, and the http protocol.

http at the begining of a url tells the browser what protocol to use.

REST is the architecture that the entire web is built on. http requests point to a resource, and the resources are defined by REST

Through Web Services and APIS, computer can interact and share resources with eachother using web protocols.

Redirect: when a machine asks another machine to retrive resources from ANOTHER machine.

Poloymorphism: A paradigm of Object Orient Programming. It refers to the idea that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them. Practical Example: two methods could share the same name, but perform two different actions. Or how get and grab are differnet words, but can mean the same thing.

GET , DELETE PUT are universal verbs. and are all HTTP Protocal actions.

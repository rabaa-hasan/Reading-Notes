# Programming with JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
## ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array.
### VALU ES IN ARRAYS

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
var color = 'beige';
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE   
var area = 3 * 2;

## CSS Layout
### Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include:

`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:

`<img> <b> <i>`

### Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements. The containing element is always the direct parent of that element.

### Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

#### Normal Flow

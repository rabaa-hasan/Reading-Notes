# Forms
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.

Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or you need to create more complicated insurance applications, HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from your users.

### Why Forms?
The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.

List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

## Events JavaScript

### HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE

1. Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to.
2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. Programmers call this binding an event to a DOM node.
3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs.

### Event Flow

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
